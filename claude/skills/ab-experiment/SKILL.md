description: "Use when Brian says 'run this side by side', 'A/B this', or wants to measure whether a prompting/context/workflow change (handoff doc, CLAUDE.md variant, new skill, plan style) actually helps. Runs two identical-plan sessions differing by one treatment, mines both session JSONLs, blind-grades outputs, commits an evidence doc."

# /ab-experiment

Measure whether ONE change (treatment) helps, with real numbers and blind grades. Precedent: three handoff A/B tests in `~/git/skills/handoff/evidence/`, including a decisive negative result — negative results are a success, report them proudly.

Existing tooling — reuse, do not rewrite:
- Metrics miner: `~/git/skills/handoff/eval/compare_implementations.py`
- Grading rubric: `~/git/skills/handoff/eval/prompts/grade-implementation.md`
- Evidence format: `~/git/skills/handoff/evidence/2026-03-24-candidate-eval-implementation-ab-test.md`

## 1. Setup

- [ ] State the hypothesis in one sentence and identify the treatment. Exactly ONE variable differs between arms. If the proposal bundles two changes, stop and ask Brian which one to test.
- [ ] Name the arms after the treatment: `.worktrees/with-<X>` and `.worktrees/no-<X>`, both branched from the same base commit:
  ```bash
  git worktree add .worktrees/with-<X> -b eval/with-<X> <base>
  git worktree add .worktrees/no-<X> -b eval/no-<X> <base>
  ```
- [ ] Both arms get the IDENTICAL plan/prompt text. Only the treatment differs (extra doc, CLAUDE.md variant, skill present/absent, etc.).
- [ ] Absolute paths only in launch commands — especially `--append-system-prompt-file`. Relative paths break when cwd resets.
- [ ] Write both launch commands into an `eval-state.json` next to the worktrees (arm name, worktree path, branch, command, session-dir path) so the measure step is mechanical.

## 2. Run

- [ ] If THIS session is interactive: do NOT run `claude -p` inline — nested interactive→headless hangs. Print both launch commands and have Brian run them in a separate terminal, or launch them as background Bash jobs and Monitor.
- [ ] Run both arms in the same wall-clock window where possible (same model snapshot, same load conditions).
- [ ] On API 401/500 mid-run (headless OAuth tokens expire ~8h and do NOT auto-refresh; the 401 lands in the session JSONL, not stderr — process just exits rc=1): relaunch the dead arm and aggregate metrics across all runs of that arm (Mar 24 precedent). Note the relaunch in the evidence doc.

## 3. Measure

- [ ] Find each arm's main session JSONL by LARGEST FILE SIZE, never newest mtime (subagent/stub sessions are newer but tiny):
  ```bash
  ls -S ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-worktree-path>/*.jsonl | head -1
  ```
- [ ] Run the miner:
  ```bash
  python3 ~/git/skills/handoff/eval/compare_implementations.py \
    --state-file <abs path>/eval-state.json --repo-root <abs repo root>
  ```
- [ ] Effective tokens = input + output + cache_read + cache_creation. Never compare on input+output alone — cache traffic is where the cost lives.
- [ ] Capture per arm: effective tokens, tool calls (bash/read/agent breakdown), turns, wall time, tests passing, lines added/removed. If an arm had relaunches, sum across runs.

## 4. Grade

- [ ] Grade with SUBAGENTS in this session (subscription). Never API, never promptfoo — rejected twice; `claude -p` also burns subscription anyway (June 2026 billing change paused).
- [ ] Blind the graders: give each subagent ONLY the git diff of one arm plus the rubric at `~/git/skills/handoff/eval/prompts/grade-implementation.md`. Strip arm names, branch names, commit messages, and any PR-style claims — metadata biases graders measurably.
- [ ] Graders inflate without a written rubric: always attach the rubric, require per-criterion scores, and require explicit deductions of −1.5 to −2 for correctness bugs that pass tests. Never grade spec-compliance alone.
- [ ] Use 2 graders per arm; if they disagree by >1 point on total, run a third and take the median.
- [ ] Only after all scores are in, unblind and map scores to arms.

## 5. Report

- [ ] Write the evidence doc into the relevant `evidence/` corpus (pattern: `handoff/evidence/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-ab-test.md`). Sections:
  1. Hypothesis + treatment (one line each)
  2. Setup (base commit, plan, launch commands, relaunches)
  3. Stats table (both arms, all metrics from step 3)
  4. Grader scorecards (per-criterion, blinded IDs, then unblinded mapping)
  5. Verdict — one sentence. "No effect" and "treatment hurts" are valid verdicts.
- [ ] Commit the evidence doc on the winning branch (or main via PR if neither arm merges).
- [ ] Merge the winner, kill the loser, clean up:
  ```bash
  git worktree remove .worktrees/<loser> && git worktree remove .worktrees/<winner>
  git worktree prune
  git branch -d eval/<loser-branch>
  ```

## Gotchas (hard-won, do not relearn)

- Main session JSONL = largest file, NOT newest mtime.
- Effective tokens include cache_read + cache_creation.
- Graders without a rubric inflate; correctness bugs that pass tests need explicit −1.5 to −2 deductions.
- Evals run as subagents on subscription, never API.
- Nested `claude -p` from an interactive session hangs — hand launch commands to Brian.
- Headless runs >8h die on OAuth 401 buried in the JSONL; relaunch and aggregate.
